# Census Income Classfication
## Data Cleaning  
- Check for Null values, In this case null values were present in form of "?", so replaced "?" wil NaN
- Replaced Null values with the mode
- Dropped unwanted columns
- Visualized the types of data present to see which type of encoding to use
- Used Binary encoding for data with two types (Income & Sex)
- Used Label encoding for data with more than two types
## Machine Learning Models
- Data splitting
- Train the model for Naive Bayes and Random Forest
- Test the model for Naive Bayes and Random Forest
## Evaluation
- Print the confusion matrix for Naive Bayes and Random Forest
- Print the classification report for Naive Bayes and Random Forest
